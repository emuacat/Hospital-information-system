# HospitalInfoManagement

## Overview
This repository hosts the codebase for the Hospital Information Management System (HIMS), an Angular-based application designed to manage healthcare data efficiently. Alongside the application, a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline has been implemented to streamline development, integration, testing, and deployment processes.

### Key Features
- **AWS CodeBuild and CodeDeploy**: Continuous integration and deployment using AWS services.
- **IAM Roles and Security Management**: Robust security measures for data protection.
- **Angular Application**: A feature-rich front-end interface for health management.

### Key Responsibilities:

#### AWS CodeBuild Scripting:
- Designed and maintained scripts that outline specific build instructions, utilizing AWS CodeBuild.
- Facilitated continuous integration by automatically compiling, testing, and building the code.
- Ensured alignment with best practices to optimize build performance and maintainability.

#### IAM Roles and Security Management:
- Managed AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to control access to AWS resources, specifically tailored to the needs of the HMS.
- Configured and maintained security groups to enforce firewall rules and protect the application and data from unauthorized access.
- Conducted regular audits and updates to maintain the highest level of security compliance.

#### AWS CodeDeploy Implementation:
- Created and managed configuration files for AWS CodeDeploy, allowing automated deployments to specified environments (e.g., staging, production).
- Enabled smooth transitions between development stages, reducing downtime and increasing the velocity of releases.
- Monitored deployment success and failure, providing detailed reports and rapid response to any issues.

### Technologies Used:
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodeDeploy
- AWS IAM
- Scripting languages (specific to project requirements, such as Python, Shell scripting, etc.)

### Outcome:
The implementation of the CI/CD pipeline for the Health Management System significantly enhanced the development workflow. Continuous integration allowed for faster detection and resolution of bugs, while the automated deployment process ensured that new features and updates were rolled out efficiently and securely. The project stands as a testament to the effectiveness of modern DevOps practices in creating a responsive and resilient software development lifecycle.

## This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.7.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
